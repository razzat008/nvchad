    config for nvchad v3.0

I was previously on [v2.0](https://github.com/razzat008/nvchad/tree/v2.0) but due to lot of deprecated features, I've moved my config to v3.0.
## How to install
[WARNING]: make sure to backup your existing configs 
```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
```
Then you can clone this directly using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/razzat008/nvchad ~/.config/nvim && nvim
```
Run `:MasonInstallAll` after lazy.nvim finishes downloading plugins.\
Look into official docs for nvchad [here](https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install).
